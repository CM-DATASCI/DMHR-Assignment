# DMHR-Assignment

This work was carried out as part of the assignment for a module in my Health Data Science course at University College London. The work was based around publicly available datasets from the National Health Service (NHS) and the World Health Organisations(WHO). 
The assessment consisted of two assignments which required the cleaning, processing and extraction of data from NHS and WHO datasets. 

Insights into items such as the following were gained by processing the information in these datasets:

#### GP prescribing data from the NHS
1. Descriptive statistics of London and Cambridge GP prescribing trends
